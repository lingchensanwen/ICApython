# ICApython
This is a ICA project without using scikit-lean. In a word, I write simple ICA algorithm with python.
There are 3 projects.

In the fist project, I sparate 2 mixed numeric files which means two mixed waves.

In the second project, I sparate 2 mixed music files.

In the third project, I sparate 2 mixed photo files.
