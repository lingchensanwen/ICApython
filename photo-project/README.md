1.Because I create random W to get the original source, there are two files to get great source (which has different W)

2.p1.png and p2.png is the result of running kadai3(Good source 1 lena).ipynb or kadai3(Good source 2 not lena).ipynb


3.I input the good source into source1 and source2, so check them is okay
